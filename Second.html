            <h2>Fun fact!</h2>
            <p>Octopuses have three hearts! Two pump blood to the gills, while the third pumps it to the rest of the body. When they swim, the heart that pumps to the body stops, which is why they prefer crawling over swimming.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="support-section1 grid-item">
            <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>Octopuses prefer crawling because it's more efficient for them. When they swim, their main heart stops, making it harder to circulate oxygen and energy throughout their bodies. Crawling lets them keep all three hearts pumping, which helps them conserve energy and function better.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="support-section2 grid-item">
            <h2>Again, why?</h2>
            <p>Botanically speaking, a true berry must develop from a single flower with one ovary and contain multiple seeds inside. Bananas meet this criterion because they grow from one ovary and have seeds embedded within their flesh. Strawberries, however, grow from multiple ovaries and have seeds on the outside, making them technically not berries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="main-content2 grid-item">
            <h2>Another fun fact!</h2>
            <p>Bananas are berries, but strawberries arenâ€™t! Botanically, a berry must come from a single ovary and have multiple seeds, which bananas meet, but strawberries develop from multiple ovaries, disqualifying them as true berries.</p>
